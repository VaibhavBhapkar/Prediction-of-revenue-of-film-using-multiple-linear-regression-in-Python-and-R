# Prediction-of-revenue-of-film-using-multiple-linear-regression-in-Python-and-R
This project deals to build a multiple linear regression model for prediction of revenue of film using dataset provided by TMDB which consists of 5000 movies dataset this project include following steps:
1. import dataset
2. Selecting features from dataset
3. Identifying dependent and independent attributes (features)
4. Training of regression model
5. Prediction of revenue of film

After performing this steps Performance obtained by regression model is measured by r2 performance metrics and it shows result of 0.7135.
 
This project also deals to optimize the regression model by removing unimportant attributes.
